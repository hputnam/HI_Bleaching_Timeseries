**Molecular Lab Work**  
DNA RNA Duet Extractions [online notebook post](https://emmastrand.github.io/EmmaStrand_Notebook/Kbay-Bleaching-2019-DNA-RNA-Extractions/).

Molecular samples at URI:  
- "T2" sample date 11/5/20 received shipment on 11/30/20 (black mesh bags - 2 shelves) --- this doesn't quite add up. 10/5/2020 wouldn't be T2 in 2020 sampling. 
- "T5" sample date 12/4/19 received shipment on 10/01/20 (black mesh bag)
- 10/2/19 (yellow mesh bag)  
- 10/16/19 (yellow mesh bag)  
- 10/30/19 (yellow mesh bag)  
- 12/4/19 (black mesh bag)  
- 8/27/20 (black mesh bag)

Missing 7/19/19. Was this ever shipped to URI?
